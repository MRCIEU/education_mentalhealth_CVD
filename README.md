The following scripts are for a mediation analysis of educational attainment, mental health and cardiovascular disease as in Jones, Wootton, Gill, Carter, Gunnell, Munafo & Sallis, Mental health as a mediator of the association between educational inequality and cardiovascular disease: A Mendelian randomisation study.

The scripts detail four separate analyses:

1. An observational analysis (multivariable logistic regression) of associations between educational attainment, mental health and cardiovascular disease based on UK biobank data
2. An univariable MR analysis investigating the effects of educational attainment on mental health and cardiovascular disease and the effects of mental health on cardiovascular disease
3. A multivariable MR analysis investigating the mediating role of mental health between educational attainment and cardiovascular disease
4. A further methods script detailing sensitivity analyses of the MVMR analysis

The scripts should be run in the following order:

1. Observational Analysis.R
2. UnivariableMR.R
3. MVMR.R
4. MVMR further methods.R
